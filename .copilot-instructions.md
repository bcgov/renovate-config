# Copilot Instructions for renovate-config Repository

## Critical Operations Requiring Explicit Permission

### Releases and Versioning
- **NEVER create releases, tags, or trigger release workflows without explicit user permission**
- **NEVER update version tags (v1, v2, etc.) without explicit user approval**
- **ALWAYS ask before running any workflow that could affect downstream teams**
- **ALWAYS discuss release strategy and timing before proceeding**

### Repository Management
- **NEVER force-push to main branch**
- **NEVER delete tags without explicit permission**
- **ALWAYS ask before making changes that could break downstream repositories**

### Workflow and CI/CD
- **NEVER trigger workflows that could affect production or downstream teams without permission**
- **ALWAYS test changes locally first when possible**
- **ALWAYS validate that changes won't break existing functionality**

## General Preferences
- Prefer incremental, verified changes over large refactoring
- Always ensure application functionality before proceeding
- If feedback conflicts with existing requirements or best practices, provide a reasoned explanation and seek clarification or suggest an alternative approach
- Prefer frequent and small pull requests
- Never use local .env files

## Communication
- **ALWAYS ask permission before any operation that could impact multiple teams**
- **ALWAYS explain the potential impact of changes before proceeding**
- **ALWAYS provide clear reasoning for why changes are needed**
